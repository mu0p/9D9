  <h2 class="about-heading">SO, WHO REALLY MATTERS MOST IN THE CLUB?</h2>
  <p class="about-lead">I’LL TELL YOU, IT’S YOU. THE COMMUNITY. THE PEOPLE.</p>

  <div class="about-copy">
    <p>IT’S TIME TO GIVE THE CLUB BACK TO THOSE WHO MAKE IT MAGIC. THE DANCERS, THE DREAMERS, THE BEAUTIFUL ONES WHO’VE ALWAYS MADE THE CLUB A COMMUNITY.</p>

    <p>SO, I’M REMOVING THE DJ FROM THE STAGE, HELL, FROM THE WHOLE ROOM. THEY’LL BE HIDDEN, ABLE TO MONITOR THE DANCE FLOOR, BUT YOU WON’T BE ABLE TO MONITOR THEM. THEY SAY, “NOBODY PUTS DJ IN A CORNER.” WELL, IN THE 70S, THEY DID, AND I WILL. …</p>

    <p>YOU ARE HERE TO GET TO KNOW YOURSELF, TO GET TO KNOW YOUR COMMUNITY. TO EXPRESS YOURSELF, TO MOVE YOURSELF, TO LOSE YOURSELF IN THE BEAT. FIND A DARK CORNER OR A LIT‑UP CENTER, IT’S UP TO YOU, BUT WHATEVER YOU DO, DANCE.</p>

    <p>THIS IS ABOUT BRINGING THE DANCEFLOOR BACK TO THE PEOPLE.</p>
    
    <p>EXPECT A BRAND NEW DANCEFLOOR CONCEPT BROUGHT TO YOU BY A 20+ YEAR VETERAN LIGHTING DESIGNER, AND A SURROUND SOUND TO KEEP YOU MOVING NO MATTER WHERE YOU ARE ON THE DANCEFLOOR.</p>
